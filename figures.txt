This is the relation between TF controlling strength (the product of DNAse accessiblity and TF binding strength) and it's mRNA expression. The data file is produced by controlPrediction.out. The controlPrediction.out program needs two arguments - a folder and a file (currently those are hard-coded). First, a folder with result of analyzeTFbinding.out program. This folder contains many files named id_analyzeTFbinding.dat. By default these files are located in the tfInfo/analyzeTFbinding_results. Second, a folder with result of identifyControlTFs.out program. This folder contains many files named id_controlTFs.txt. Each file contains one line - the gene id is the first column, the second column is comma-separated list of TFs that control this gene. All these file must be united into a single file (by cat command) and this file is supplied as input to the controlPredict.out program. So controlPredict.out program creates file controlledGenesSummary.dat. This is the one to use for Fig.2. See gnuplot script.

This is the histogram of coverage (number of bases with non-zero coverage) vs gene length for protein coding genes and lncRNAs. Data file are created by coverageLengthAnalysis.out progams. This program creates two files needed for the figure - ERR655291_proteinBinData.dat and ERR655291_lncrnaBinData.dat. ERR655291 is ID, there are in total 7 different IDs. These files contain only histogram data and nothing else. The first column is bin gene length (with step of 10000), the second column is mean coverage. These files are located in the lncrnaWorks1 folder. This folder contains one example, other files can be plotted too.

The histograms of the number of alignments for A and S-group lncRNAs. lncRNAs are divided into A and S-group by program coverageLengthAnalysis.out. This program outputs two files id_outlierNames.txt (A-group) and id_noOutlierNames (S-group). All lncRNAs are pre-aligned to the HUVEC CAGE data (there are multiple files and they are also identified by ID). The program blastAlignmentAnalysis.out counts the number of times each lncRNA aligns. The output of this program is file CAGEid_lncrnaGeneInteractionsCount.dat and these files are in the lncrnaInfo1 folder by default. The small program lncrnaContactAnalysis.out extracts from this file entries belonging to A or S-ground lncRNAs putting them into files id_AgroupContactCounts.dat and id_SgrounpContactCounts.dat. Currently only one CAGE data set is used for the analysis - ENCFF179TLJ, so files are not marked with CAGE id.
